abstract = {Markov modeling presents an attractive analytical framework for researchers who are interested in state-switching processes occurring within a person, dyad, family, group, or other system over time. Markov modeling is flexible and can be used with various types of data to study observed or latent state-switching processes, and can include subject-specific random effects to account for heterogeneity. We focus on the application of mixed Markov models to intensive longitudinal data sets in psychology, which are becoming ever more common and provide a rich description of each subject's process. We examine how specifications of a Markov model change when continuous random effect distributions are included, and how mixed Markov models can be used in the intensive longitudinal research context. Advantages of Bayesian estimation are discussed and the approach is illustrated by two empirical applications.},

abstract = {For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Students' activities in game/scenario-based tasks (G/SBTs, hereafter) can be characterized by a sequence of time-stamped actions of different types with different attributes. For a subset of the G/SBTs where only the order of the actions are of great interest, the process data can be well characterized as a string of characters (action string, hereafter) if we encode each action name as a single character. In this paper, we report our work on evaluating students' performances by comparing how far their action strings are from the action string that corresponds to the best performance, where the proximity is quantified by the edit distance between the strings. Specifically, we choose the Levenshtein distance, which is defined as the minimum number of insertion, deletion and replacement needed to convert one character string to another. Our results show a strong correlation between the edit distances and the scores obtained from the scoring rubrics of the WELL task from NAEP TEL, implying the edit distance to the best performance sequence can be considered as a new feature variable that encodes information about students' proficiency, which sheds light on the value of data driven scoring rules for test and task development and for refining the scoring rubrics.},

abstract = {This article reviews how National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has come to collect and analyze data about cognitive and behavioral processes (process data) in the transition to digital assessment technologies over the past two decades. An ordered five-level structure is proposed for describing the uses of process data. The levels in this hierarchy range from ignoring the processes (i.e., counting only the outcomes), to incorporating process data as auxiliary or essential in addition to the outcome, to modeling the process as the outcome itself, either holistically in a rubric score or in a measurement model that accounts for sequential dependencies. Historical examples of these different uses are described as well as recent results using nontraditional analytical approaches. In the final section, speculative future directions incorporating state-of-the-art technologies and analysis methods are described with an eye toward hard-to-measure constructs such as higher order problem-solving and col...},
